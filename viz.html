                <h1>Where memes from the past decade came from</h1>
                <p>Know Your Meme, a website that tracks the history and origins of memes, analyzed a decade of meme data,
                    to determine from which platforms did the most memes originate.
                </p> 
                <p>It's interesting to see how at the beginning of the decade Youtube and 4chan generated 60%-70% of memes,
                    but now Twitter and TikTok seemed to have replaced these platforms. 4chan has experienced a steep decline, with their meme 
                    origin percentage at around 1%.
                </p>    
                <p>While the chart is interesting to look at, there is a lack of contrast due to the usage of different shades of blue both in the 
                    background and in the lines used to represent the platforms. Changing the color of the background will help increase the
                    contrast and improve readability.
